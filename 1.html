<font color="#FFFFFF">Captain America: The First Avenger 

It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins. 

During World War 2, Steve Rogers who is frail and sickly tries to enlist but is rejected because of his condition. But when a scientist sees his determination, he allows him to be accepted. What Steve doesn't know is that he is the man in charge of a government project to create a super soldier and when the military man in charge of the project can't see what the scientist sees in Rogers, the scientist thinks that Steve has the character that is needed. Johann Schmidt, the head of the German science division known as HYDRA who knows the scientist and fears that if his project is a success, it could mean trouble for them. So he sends a man who infiltrated the Americans to see if the project is a success and if it is, to "take care" of the scientist. And when it is he kills the scientist. Steve, with his new abilities, chases the spy down. When several soldiers are held prisoner, he is sent under the codename Captain America to rescue them. During the rescue he learns what Schmidt's plans are, and when he reports to his superiors, he forms a unit to thwart his plans.
